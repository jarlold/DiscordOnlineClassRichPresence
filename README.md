# DiscordOnlineClassRichPresence
Python script that shows your online class schedule through Discord Rich Presence.

# Setup
1. Download the executable file and the schedule.txt
2. Fill out the schedule, see below for how (but it's pretty obviouse)
3. Make sure schedule.txt and the OnlineClassRichPresence.exe are in the same folder,
   and that schedule.txt is named schedule.txt.
4. Launch OnlineClassRichPresence.exe
5. You should see a console appear saying the program has launched, if it only appears for
   a moment, it means Python has crashed because I'm a bad developer.
   
# Schedule setup.

1. Create a file named schedule.txt if it doesn't already exist.
2. The first line should either say "AM" or "24" (without the quotes) to indicate whether or not
   you'd like to use an AM/PM clock or a 24-hour clock.
3. Then add 1 line for each of your classes, in the following format

    `Class Name, day_of_week, start_time, end_time`
    so for example
    `PhysEd, monday, 9:30, 11:30`
    would schedule physed from 9:30 to 11:30 on a monday. It's pretty simple system.

I didn't sign it, because I don't have a certificate to sign it with, and I'm not giving 
Microsoft money to get one. I'm not even a Windows user, I run Linux.

# Linux support
Figure it out yourself, you're a Linux user.
